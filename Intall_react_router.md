### Install react router dom


today,I come across a problem when i try to intall the react router to an old integrated react h5 framework,because i intall the react-router firstly.

when I  uninstall the react-router and change to react-router-dom,the old history package don't delete.and it will make bug with the new react-router-dom.

the right choice it to remove the node_modules and reinstall it.
